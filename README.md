# Haskell solutions for Project Euler

Here are solutions to the (soon) first 100 [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in Haskell.

They work, but are probably not the most efficient / elegant solutions.

If you have any idea for an improvement, feel free to contribute, I would gladly approve new solutions.

## ⚙ Running the programs

These programs should all run without any external libraries.

Most programs where run from `ghci` but a handful needed to be compiled in order to end quickly. I used `ghc -O3` because I'm impatient.

## ⭐ Some of my favorites solutions

|  Problem   |   Summary   |    Explanation    |
| :--------: | :---------: | :---------------: |
| problem 54 | Poker Hands | Nice use of types |

## ⁉ Isn't sharing solutions banned ?

According to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish), one is allowed to share solutions for the first 100 problems.

> However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.

The aim of this repo is for one to compare one's haskell solution with mine.
